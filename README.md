# phởdav

## About

phởdav is a WebDav server implementation using libsoup (RFC 4918).

Releases are uploaded in [GNOME's FTP](http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/phodav/)
and in the [tags section](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/phodav/-/tags)

## Tools

* chezdav, allows to share a particual directory (with optional
  digest authentication)

## Notes

phởdav was initially developped as a filesharing mechanism for Spice,
but it is generic enough to be reused in other projects, in particular
in the GNOME desktop. Further integration work would be a welcome
contribution!
