# phởdav

## About

phởdav is a WebDav server implementation using libsoup (RFC 4918).

Releases: http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/phodav/

## Tools

* chezdav, allows to share a particual directory (with optional
  digest authentication)

## Notes

phởdav was initially developped as a filesharing mechanism for Spice,
but it is generic enough to be reused in other projects, in particular
in the GNOME desktop. Further integration work would be a welcome
contribution!
